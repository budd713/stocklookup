## About
This application is my first experience building a website with Node.js and Express-Handlebars. 
It contains a stock lookup tool that pulls financial data via IEX Cloud Financial Data API.
The site is hosted by Heroku: https://buddnodestock.herokuapp.com/

## Usage
In the top-right corner, enter the ticker symbol of the US-listed stock you wish to look up in the search bar.
