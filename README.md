## About
This application is my first experience building a website with Node.js and Express-Handlebars. 
It contains a stock lookup tool that pulls financial data via IEX Cloud Financial Data API.
The site is hosted by Heroku: https://buddnodestock.herokuapp.com/

## Usage
If you are using mobile, click on the menu button at the top-right corner and the search bar will appear. If you are using desktop, you should already see the search bar at the top-right corner.

In the search bar, enter the ticker symbol of the US-listed stock you wish to look up. The page will then display relevant details on the stock, including:
* Latest price
* Price at previous market close
* Market cap
* YTD change
* 52-week high
* 52-week low
